    <p>The Toronto Ontario Temple is the 44th operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). It was the second temple to be dedicated in Canada (after the Cardston Alberta Temple), making it the first country in the world, outside the United States, to have two temples within its borders at the time of dedication. Germany became the second country outside the United States to have two temples when Germany reunified six weeks later.</p>
    <p><h3>See you in the Temple</h3></p>

    <p>n the Latter Day Saint movement, a temple is a building dedicated to be a house of God and is reserved for special forms of worship. A temple differs from a church meetinghouse, which is used for weekly worship services</p>
    <p>Temples have been a significant part of the Latter Day Saint movement since early in its inception.</p>
